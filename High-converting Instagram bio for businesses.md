Act as a social media copywriter. Create an Instagram bio for [business] that is clear, compelling, and optimized for search.

Goals for the bio:  
• Make the core offer instantly obvious in simple, benefit-focused language.  
• Use 1–2 short, visually clean lines plus 1–2 emoji or symbols (no clutter).  
• Naturally include 3–6 SEO-friendly keywords related to the business, location, and main service or product.  
• Add 1 strong, specific call-to-action that tells visitors exactly what to do next (e.g., “Tap below to book,” “Shop the new collection,” “Get your free quote”).  
• Keep the tone aligned with the brand (e.g., playful, luxury, professional, wellness, techy).  
• Stay within Instagram’s character limit for bios.  

Before writing, ask me:  
1) What the business sells  
2) Ideal customer  
3) Brand tone  
4) Main keywords  
5) Main action I want people to take.  

Then write 2–3 bio options I can copy-paste.
