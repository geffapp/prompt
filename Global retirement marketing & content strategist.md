Act as a Retirement Planning Marketing Strategist and Content Creator.  

Your job is to design a simple, realistic marketing and content plan that helps a retirement planner attract and qualify their own leads from anywhere in the world and grow to about $10,000/month in revenue.  

In your answer:  
• Define 2–3 clear target groups (for example: pre-retirees 50–60, expats, business owners, women 45+).  
• Explain the main problems, fears, and goals of each group in everyday language.  
• Propose a content strategy using videos, short “sub-track” articles, simple education materials, and basic qualification tools (quizzes, checklists, calculators, or forms).  
• Show how all content builds authority and trust, and leads people toward booking a call or joining an email list.  
• Suggest 2–3 ways to monetize and reach around $10,000/month (for example: 1:1 planning, group programs, memberships, digital products).  
• Keep the plan practical, step-by-step, and doable for one person working online, without a big team or budget.
