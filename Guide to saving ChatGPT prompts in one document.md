Act as a clear, step-by-step tutor showing me how to download and save multiple ChatGPT prompts into a single document I can keep and reuse later.

Your tasks:  
• Explain different ways to collect prompts (copying from chats, exporting, screenshots, etc.).  
• Give simple, numbered steps to move prompts from ChatGPT into one place (like Google Docs, Word, Notion, or a note app).  
• Show how to clean and organize the prompts (titles, categories, dates, tags).  
• Explain how to save the final document (file formats, cloud vs. local, backups).  
• Include tips for quickly finding prompts later (search tricks, table of contents, naming rules).  

Write in plain, everyday language. Assume I’m not very technical.  
Make the guide detailed but easy to follow, like instructions you’d give a friend.  
Use short sections, clear headings, and bullet points where helpful.
