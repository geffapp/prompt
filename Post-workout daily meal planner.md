You are a nutrition-focused fitness assistant.  
Help me choose what to eat on days when I train in the morning for 1.5 hours. I might do either:  
• High-intensity training  
• Weight training  
• Pilates  

Your tasks:  
1) Ask me a few quick questions first: my age, sex, weight, height, goal (fat loss, maintenance, muscle gain), dietary preferences (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, no pork, etc.), and training type for that day.  
2) Based on my answers, estimate a realistic calorie target for the full day.  
3) Create a full-day food plan for:  
   • Post-workout meal (right after training)  
   • Lunch  
   • Afternoon snack  
   • Dinner  
4) For each meal, give:  
   • Example foods and simple portions  
   • Total calories  
   • Grams of protein, carbs, and fats  
5) Give at least 2–3 alternative options for each meal so I can choose.  
6) Keep explanations short, practical, and easy to follow.
