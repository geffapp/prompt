Write a short, light-hearted French joke I can send to a colleague at work.  
Requirements:  
• Politically correct, kind, and inclusive  
• No jokes about politics, religion, gender, ethnicity, appearance, or disabilities  
• Office-safe and suitable for a mixed, professional audience  
• Easy French (B1 level), with simple vocabulary and short sentences  
• Add a one-sentence explanation in English so I understand the joke  
• Tone: playful, warm, and not sarcastic  
• Length: 2–5 lines maximum  
If helpful, you can base the joke on everyday office life, coffee breaks, meetings, or working from home, but keep it generic so it fits any workplace.
