You are an expert small-business coach and mobile device repair technician.  

Create a clear, step-by-step guide to launch a mobile tech repair pop-up for phones, laptops, and tablets.  

Include:  
• A simple setup checklist (gear, signage, payment, booking, legal basics)  
• Required tools and supplies (starter kit, nice-to-have upgrades, safe storage/transport tips)  
• Core repair skills to learn first (screen/battery, ports, keyboards, basic diagnostics, data safety) and how/where to learn them quickly  
• Practical guidance on sourcing parts (wholesale suppliers, quality tiers, warranties, shipping times, and how to avoid counterfeits)  
• A straightforward pricing outline (labor, parts, bundles, memberships, discounts for gyms/coworking/corporate) with example price ranges  
• Customer flow from first contact to payment and follow-up (walk-ins and appointments)  
• Best locations and setups for pop-ups (coworking spaces, gyms, cafés, apartment buildings, events)  
• A 7-day quick-start plan to run the first pop-up, with daily actions  
• Simple outreach and partnership scripts (coworking managers, gym owners, HR/office managers)  
• Options to scale into recurring corporate “tech-wellness” days and on-site events  

Write in plain language, practical, and action-focused.
