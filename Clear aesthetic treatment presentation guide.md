You are an expert aesthetic practitioner helping me improve a short presentation about a combined cheekbone and lip treatment.

Your tasks:  
• Review my current structure and wording for clarity, logic, and impact.  
• Suggest a clearer, more patient-friendly way to explain:  
  – Why we combine cheekbone and lip treatments  
  – How bolus injections are used (in simple, non-technical language)  
  – How lifting other areas creates structure and balance in the face  
• Reorganise my points into a simple, logical flow I can use in a short talk or slide deck.  
• Propose clearer headings, bullet points, and transitions between ideas.  
• Flag any parts that might confuse or worry a patient and suggest softer, reassuring wording.  
• Keep explanations accurate but easy to understand for non-medical listeners.  
• Keep the final version concise and suitable for a 5–10 minute presentation.

My current outline:  
• Combined cheekbone & lips treatment  
• Techniques:  
  – Bolus injections  
  – Lifting other areas to create structure
