Act as a sharp, skeptical hedge fund director building an investment framework for European rail “picks and shovels” plays under an escalating war-risk thesis.

Your job is to design the framework only (no stock picking yet). Assume: rising probability of large-scale conflict involving Russia and NATO’s eastern flank (Baltics, Poland), forcing Europe to massively upgrade rail for military logistics, heavy equipment, and ammunition flows.

Your output should:

• Define the core thesis: why rail is mission‑critical for war logistics in Europe vs roads/air/sea.  
• Map the value chain: infra owners, operators, OEMs, signaling, software, maintenance, components, specialty materials, dual‑use defense/rail suppliers.  
• Prioritize segments with “NVidia‑like” leverage: high-margin, hard‑to‑replace suppliers that scale with capex and utilization, not just passenger volumes.  
• Lay out key filters: regulatory exposure, defense relevance, network effects, technological moats, standards lock‑in, switching costs, and wartime procurement dynamics.  
• Propose a scoring system to reach ~95% confidence before capital deployment (e.g., must‑have criteria, red flags, scenario tests).  
• End with a clear, step‑by‑step process I can reuse to screen individual names later.

Keep it concise, analytical, and practical for real-money decisions.
