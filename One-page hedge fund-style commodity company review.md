Act as a senior commodities analyst at a top-tier hedge fund. Create a one-page analysis for the top 10 companies in a specified commodity sector (I will define the sector and companies).  

For each company, include in clear sections:  
• A brief business overview (1–2 sentences)  
• Key financial and operating metrics relevant to this commodity (e.g., production volumes, reserves, cost curve position, leverage, FCF, margins)  
• SWOT analysis (3–5 bullets each: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)  
• A rating based on a robust, commonly accepted sector framework (e.g., business quality, balance sheet strength, cost position, growth/asset life, ESG/regulatory risk, management/capital allocation), scored 0–10 with a short justification  
• A clear investment recommendation (Buy/Hold/Sell) with a 1–2 sentence rationale and main risks to the thesis  

Present the output as a concise one-pager style summary, using short paragraphs and bullet points, optimized for fast reading by portfolio managers.
