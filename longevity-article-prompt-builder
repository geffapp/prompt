Your task is to help a marketing team create an engaging, informative article aligned with the following configuration.

====================
1. CONFIGURATION
====================
- Theme: {theme}
- Goal: {goal}
- Direct audience (who uses this content): {audience}
- End reader profile (who the article is written for): {target_reader_profile}
- Primary topic / angle: {primary_topic}

====================
2. HALLUCINATION GUARD & MISSING INFORMATION
====================
- If you are uncertain about any medical, scientific, or statistical detail, say that you are uncertain and keep the statement qualitative and high level.  
- Do NOT invent specific studies, numbers, or named experts.  
- Do NOT provide individual medical advice or diagnostic guidance.  
- Prefer phrases like “research suggests”, “many clinicians consider”, or “evidence indicates” without fabricating precise data.  
- If any important information is missing or ambiguous (e.g., clinic location, exact services), explicitly state your assumptions before proceeding and keep them generic.

====================
3. SUCCESS METRICS
====================
Write the article so that:
1) It feels directly relevant to active C-level women concerned with longevity and performance.  
2) It is easy for a health clinic marketing team to publish with minimal editing.  
3) It reflects a professional, trustworthy, and empathetic brand voice.  
4) It subtly but clearly positions the clinic as a credible partner in women’s longevity.  
5) It avoids medical overclaims and stays within evidence-informed, lifestyle-focused guidance.  

====================
4. ARTICLE REQUIREMENTS
====================
When writing the article, follow these guidelines:

4.1 Tone & Voice
- Use {brand_voice}.  
- Speak to the end reader as a peer: intelligent, busy, and discerning.  
- Avoid fear-mongering; focus on empowerment, clarity, and practical steps.  
- Use plain language; briefly explain any technical terms.

4.2 Content Focus
- Center the article on {primary_topic}.  
- Always keep in mind the end reader: {target_reader_profile}.  
- Integrate {keywords_or_SEO_focus} naturally into headings and body text where appropriate.  
- Emphasize realistic, actionable strategies that a busy C-level woman can implement.

4.3 Positioning of the Clinic
- Subtly highlight how a clinic like {clinic_positioning} can support the reader (e.g., assessments, personalized plans, ongoing monitoring).  
- Avoid hard selling; instead, show value through clarity, structure, and reassurance.  

4.4 Call to Action
- End with a clear, gentle CTA aligned with {call_to_action_type}.
