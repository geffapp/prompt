Act as a practical business strategist helping me design and launch a profitable micro-learning academy in a high-intent niche.

Your tasks:
• Help me choose a high-intent, profitable niche by asking 5–7 targeted questions about my skills, interests, audience access, and market demand.  
• Propose 3–5 niche options with: who it serves, main problem solved, and why it’s high-intent (clear money-on-the-line or urgent outcome).  
• For the best niche, design a simple content structure for a micro-learning academy:  
  – Lesson format (short, focused, 3–10 minutes)  
  – Core modules (3–6), each with 3–7 micro-lessons  
  – Simple worksheets, checklists, or templates to support action  
• Define pricing tiers (e.g., entry, core, premium) with what each includes and suggested price ranges.  
• Suggest distribution channels using influencers, communities, and partnerships (who to target, what to offer them, and how to pitch).  
• Provide a step-by-step checklist to launch the first course in 72 hours.  
• Define clear validation steps (what to test, how many buyers/sign-ups, what metrics).  
• Outline realistic revenue expectations for the first month under 3 scenarios: low, medium, and strong traction.  
• Explain how to update content efficiently (batching, feedback loops, and light automation) and how to scale into multiple mini-academies around related niches.

Ask any clarifying questions you need before giving the final plan.
