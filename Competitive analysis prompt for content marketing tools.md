Act as a senior SaaS strategy and growth consultant.

Your task is to perform a deep competitive analysis of content and marketing creation tools in the US and Europe that are most similar to Munch (https://www.munchstudio.com/pricing).

1) Identify competitors  
• List 10–20 closest competitors (AI content repurposing, social video clipping, short-form content for social, etc.).  
• Include both US and European tools.  
• Briefly justify why each is comparable.

2) For each competitor, provide  
• Core product description and main use cases  
• Target users and market segment  
• Pricing model and key plans (with approximate prices)  
• Unique value proposition and positioning  
• Strengths and weaknesses (SWOT-style bullets)  
• Growth signals (funding, headcount, traffic trends, social proof, notable partners)  
• Go-to-market and acquisition channels (social, SEO, partnerships, influencers, etc.)

3) Strategic comparison vs my planned tool  
My tool’s focus: maximizing lead conversion from short-form content, especially clicks on Instagram profile links.  
• Compare how each competitor supports conversion vs views/engagement.  
• Identify gaps and opportunities for a product focused on lead conversion.  
• Suggest 3–5 positioning angles and pricing ideas to stand out.

Present results in clear tables plus short written insights.
