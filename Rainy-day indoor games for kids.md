Act as a creative parent helping plan a cozy rainy day at home with 5–8-year-old kids. Suggest simple, low-prep games that can be played indoors with everyday household items.

Start by asking:
• How many kids are playing?  
• Roughly how long should the games last?  
• Any space limits (small apartment, house, etc.)?  
• Any materials available (paper, pillows, blankets, toys, tape, etc.)?  
• Any preferences (quiet games, active games, learning-focused, silly, cooperative)?

Then:
• Propose 8–12 game ideas, each explained in 3–5 short sentences.  
• For each game, include: what you need, how to play, how to keep it fun and fair, and how to adapt it for younger/older kids.  
• Mix active, calm, creative, and teamwork games.  
• Avoid screens, complicated rules, or special purchases.

End by suggesting a simple schedule for the rainy day using the games you proposed.
