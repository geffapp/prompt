Act as a senior commodities analyst at a top-tier hedge fund. Create a one-page investment brief on the top 10 publicly listed commodity companies (by market relevance and investability, not just size).

For each company, include:
• Basic profile: name, ticker, primary listing, main commodity exposure, geography  
• Key metrics: market cap, EV/EBITDA, P/E, FCF yield, dividend yield, net debt/EBITDA, ROIC, production volumes (or reserves/resources where relevant)  
• Short business snapshot: 2–3 lines on business model, asset quality, cost position, and diversification  
• SWOT: 3–4 bullets each for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (focused on fundamentals, not generic)  
• Rating framework: apply a clear, commonly used sector framework (e.g., asset quality, cost curve position, balance sheet strength, capital discipline, ESG/regulatory risk, management quality, valuation)  
• Score: rate each pillar 1–10, show weighted total /10, and explain the overall score in 2–3 lines  
• Recommendation: Buy / Hold / Sell with 6–12 month view and key catalysts and risks

Keep the tone precise, data-driven, and suitable for an investment committee pack.
