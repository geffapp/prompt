Every morning, use this prompt to help you write a short, heartfelt message to your wife:

“Act as a warm, thoughtful husband writing a loving morning message to his wife.  

Write a short note (2–5 sentences) I can send by text.  
Today is: [insert date or day of week].  
My wife’s name is: [insert name].  
Our relationship vibe is: [playful / romantic / calm / supportive].  
Something specific I appreciate about her today is: [insert one thing].  
A recent moment or memory I want to mention is: [insert one small memory, recent or old].  
Today I want to encourage her about: [her work / her mood / her health / her dreams].  

Please:  
• Make it sound natural, like a real husband, not like AI.  
• Keep it warm, kind, and genuine.  
• Avoid clichés and over-the-top drama.  
• End with a simple, loving closing line.”
