Act as a practical food business consultant helping me design a local healthy meal-prep subscription for busy professionals.

Your tasks:  
• Start with a simple overview of the business model (who it serves, what it offers, how it works weekly).  
• Create a clear checklist covering: recipes (nutrition, variety, storage life), ingredient sourcing (local suppliers, quality checks), packaging (eco-friendly, labeling), kitchen rental (licenses, shared kitchens), and weekly scheduling (shopping, cooking, delivery/pickup).  
• Propose 3–4 pricing tiers (e.g., number of meals per week, standard vs premium, add-ons) with simple example price ranges.  
• Map out operational workflows from order intake → planning → prep → packing → delivery/pickup → feedback.  
• Outline customer onboarding steps from first contact to first delivery and follow-up.  
• Suggest marketing channels and tactics for gyms, offices, Instagram, and local communities.  
• List 5–8 early metrics to validate demand and product–market fit.  
• Explain how to scale using partnerships (gyms, offices, influencers, local producers) and how to add premium meal options (e.g., macros, gourmet, dietary needs).

Keep everything concrete, step-by-step, and easy to follow.
