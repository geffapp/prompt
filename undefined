## Prompt

1. What you’re creating

You’re creating a short, clear prompt that helps a marketing director build a message framework for an online supplement retailer, tailored to different customer segments. The focus is on making it easy to brief an AI (or team) to generate consistent, targeted messaging for each segment.

Essence: Targeted messaging guide for supplement retailer

⸻

2. Key elements to include

1. A direct instruction to act as a senior marketing strategist for an online supplement retailer.  
2. A request to identify and define 3–5 key customer segments (e.g., performance-focused, wellness-focused, budget-conscious, condition-specific).  
3. A structure for each segment that includes:
   - Segment name and short description  
   - Main needs, pains, and motivations  
   - Key benefits and proof points to highlight  
   - Tone and style guidelines  
   - Core message or value proposition sentence  
   - 2–3 example headlines or ad hooks  
4. A request to keep language clear, benefit-led, and compliant-sounding (no medical claims).  
5. A request for the final output to be in a simple, skimmable format the marketing director can share with their team.

3. Writing guidance

Write the prompt as if you’re briefing a smart assistant: clear, direct, and free of buzzwords. Use plain language and short sentences so the marketing director can quickly see how each segment will be addressed. Emphasise customer needs and benefits, not product features alone. Ask for concrete examples (like headlines and hooks) so the framework is immediately usable in campaigns. Keep it short and focused, so it feels like a quick tool, not a long document.
