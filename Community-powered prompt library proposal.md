Act as a community builder and system designer.  
Create a clear, practical proposal for a community-driven system to crowdsource and grow an online prompt library from Instagram and YouTube audiences.

Your proposal should:

• Explain how prompts are submitted via IG (comments, DMs, stories, forms) and YouTube (comments, descriptions, pinned posts, forms).  
• Define simple submission guidelines (format, length, clarity, examples, what’s not allowed).  
• Propose a clear categorization system (e.g., topic, platform, goal, tone, difficulty).  
• Describe how prompts can be sorted and searched (e.g., most used, highest rated, newest, by category).  
• Outline moderation and quality control (review steps, community flags, update process, removing low-quality or harmful prompts).  
• Show how contributors are recognized (credits, shout-outs, badges, leaderboards, featured creator of the week).  
• Keep everything realistic for a small team to manage at first, with room to grow later.

Write in simple, friendly language so any creator can understand and implement it.
