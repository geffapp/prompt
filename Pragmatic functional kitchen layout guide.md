You are an expert kitchen designer and architect. Create a clear, pragmatic visual guide that explains the logic of a highly functional, comfortable open kitchen, not the decor or style.

Show, in one image, the key principles used by professional kitchen designers (e.g. work triangle, ergonomic heights, workflow zoning) and evidence-based rules from well-known designers and architects.

Include:
• The main zones: cooking, prep, cleaning, storage, serving.  
• The work triangle logic (sink–hob–fridge) with ideal distances.  
• Recommended countertop heights and upper cabinet heights for average adults.  
• Logical circulation paths so people don’t cross or collide.  
• Where to place everyday items vs. occasional items.  
• Clear labels and simple arrows to explain movement and reach.  

Style: simple, schematic, almost like an instructional poster. Prioritize clarity, proportions, and annotations over decoration. Neutral colors, top-down or side-view diagrams, easy to understand at a glance.
