Create a clear, expert-based visual guide that explains the logic of a highly functional open kitchen, focusing on ergonomics, flow, and organization rather than decor or style.

You are an expert kitchen designer and architect.  
Create a single, detailed image that explains the logic of a comfortable, efficient open kitchen layout, using proven principles from well-known designers (e.g., the kitchen work triangle, work zones, ergonomic heights).

The image should:
- Show an open kitchen seen in simple 2D or 3D, with labels and arrows.  
- Highlight: cooking zone, prep zone, cleaning zone, storage zones, and serving/eating area.  
- Indicate ideal circulation flow between fridge, sink, and cooktop.  
- Show recommended counter heights, upper cabinet heights, and clearances for walking and opening doors.  
- Emphasize practicality, safety, and comfort, not decoration.  
- Use simple colors, clean lines, and readable labels, like an architect’s diagram.

Make the overall style: clear, instructional, and easy to understand for a homeowner planning a functional open kitchen.
