Create a clear, visual explanation image that shows the logic of a highly functional open kitchen, based on proven kitchen design and architecture principles (not decor or style).

Focus on:
• Ideal work triangle (sink, stove, fridge) and circulation flow  
• Recommended heights and depths for counters, wall cabinets, island, appliances  
• Clear zoning: prep, cooking, cleaning, storage, serving, seating  
• Safe distances around cooktop, sink, and between island and cabinets  
• Practical storage logic (heavy items low, daily items at hand level, vertical storage, drawers vs. doors)  
• Accessibility and ergonomics for everyday use  

Use well-known kitchen design logic (e.g., work triangle, zoning, ergonomic reach ranges) and reference established standards from professional kitchen designers and architects.  

Present the result as a clean, labeled diagram or infographic, with arrows, dimensions, and short notes that explain why each choice improves comfort, safety, and efficiency in an open kitchen.
