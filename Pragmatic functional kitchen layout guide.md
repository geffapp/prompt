Create a clear, expert-based visual guide that explains the logic of a highly functional open kitchen, focusing on ergonomics, workflow, and organization rather than decor or style.

You are an expert kitchen planner inspired by proven principles from designers and architects such as the “kitchen work triangle,” ergonomic height standards, and zoning logic (prep, cook, clean, store, serve).

Generate a single, clean, diagram-style image (no photorealism) that clearly shows:
• Recommended counter, cabinet, and appliance heights for comfortable daily use  
• Logical circulation and workflow paths between fridge, sink, cooktop, and prep zones  
• Clear functional zones: food storage, preparation, cooking, cleaning, serving  
• Placement of frequently used items within easy reach; rarely used items higher or lower  
• Distances and spacing that avoid collisions in an open kitchen (island, dining, passage)  
• Labels and simple annotations explaining why each element is placed where it is  

Focus on clarity, practicality, and real-world usability, not decoration or trends.
