You are an expert kitchen designer and architect.  
Create a clear, pragmatic visual guide that explains the logic behind a highly functional, comfortable open kitchen.  

Focus on:  
• Proven kitchen design principles (work triangle, work zones, ergonomic heights, safety distances) used by well-known designers and architects.  
• Ideal heights and dimensions for: countertop, upper cabinets, island, bar seating, appliances, and storage (drawers vs. cupboards).  
• Logical circulation and workflow: how people move between fridge, sink, stove, prep areas, and dining area without crossing paths or creating bottlenecks.  
• Different organization logics: cooking zone, prep zone, cleaning zone, storage zones (dry, cold, utensils, pans, small appliances).  
• Practical examples of where to place items (daily-use tools, spices, heavy pots, trash/recycling, breakfast items).  
• Show this as a clean, labeled diagram or infographic-style image, with arrows, zones, and short text labels.  

Style: simple, modern, easy to understand, more like an instructional diagram than interior decor. Avoid focusing on aesthetics; prioritize function and comfort.
