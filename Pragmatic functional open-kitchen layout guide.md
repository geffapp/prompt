You are an expert kitchen designer and architect.  
Create a clear, pragmatic visual guide that explains the logic behind a highly functional, comfortable open-plan kitchen.  

Focus on:  
• Proven ergonomic rules (kitchen work triangle, work zones, reach ranges, clearances, circulation paths) used by well-known kitchen designers and architects.  
• Heights and dimensions: countertop height, upper cabinet height, island height, toe kicks, clearances between counters and island, walking aisles, and seating space.  
• Logical organization: cooking zone, prep zone, cleaning zone, storage zones (daily use vs occasional), pantry, fridge placement, and waste/recycling.  
• Flow of movement: how someone moves from fridge → sink → prep → cook → serve, including how multiple people can work without collisions.  
• Open-kitchen specifics: relation to dining/living area, noise and smell control, where to place seating, and how to keep main work areas out of traffic paths.  

Present this as a single, easy-to-read diagram or infographic-style image with labels, arrows, and short notes explaining each design choice and rule.
