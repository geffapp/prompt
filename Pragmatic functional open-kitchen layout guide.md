You are a kitchen design expert and architect. Create a clear, didactic image that explains the logic of a highly functional, comfortable open kitchen, based on proven professional principles (e.g. work triangle, ergonomic heights, workflow zoning).

Focus on:
• Showing ideal circulation paths between fridge, sink, cooktop, and prep areas  
• Indicating recommended counter heights, upper cabinet heights, and distances between island and cabinets  
• Explaining zoning: cooking, prep, cleaning, storage, breakfast/snack, and social area  
• Highlighting safety and comfort: clearances around cooktop, dishwasher door space, walking aisles  
• Using simple labels, arrows, and dimensions to make the logic easy to understand  

Do not focus on decorative style. Keep colors neutral and minimal. The goal is an educational, schematic illustration that could be used by a homeowner to plan a practical open kitchen layout, following established kitchen design and architectural best practices.
