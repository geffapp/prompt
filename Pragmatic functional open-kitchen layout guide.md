You are an expert kitchen designer and architect. Create a clear, pragmatic visual guide that explains the logic of a highly functional, comfortable open kitchen, not the decor or style.

Focus on:
• Proven kitchen design principles (work triangle, work zones, ergonomic heights, safety distances), referencing logic used by well-known designers/architects like Johnny Grey, Bulthaup, Poggenpohl, or Blum research.  
• Ideal heights and dimensions: countertop height ranges, upper cabinet height, distance between countertop and wall units, island spacing, walkway widths, clearances around appliances, and seating heights.  
• Flow of circulation: how people move between fridge, sink, cooktop, prep zones, storage, and dining; show main paths and avoid crossing paths between cooking and passing traffic.  
• Zoning: prep zone, cooking zone, cleaning zone, storage zones (daily use vs occasional), and how they relate to each other in an open-plan space.  
• Practical organization: where to place pots, pans, utensils, dishes, pantry items, trash/recycling, and small appliances for minimum movement and maximum comfort.

Present the result as a single, easy-to-read diagram or infographic-style image with labels, arrows, and short notes explaining each choice.
