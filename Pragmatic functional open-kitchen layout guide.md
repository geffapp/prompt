You are an expert kitchen planner and architect.  
Your task is to create a single clear image that explains the logic of a highly functional, comfortable open kitchen, not its decorative style.

Focus on:  
• Proven ergonomic rules from well-known kitchen designers and architects (e.g. kitchen work triangle, work zones, optimal counter heights, safety distances).  
• The flow of circulation: how people move between fridge, sink, cooktop, prep area, storage, and dining.  
• Recommended dimensions and heights: counter height, upper cabinets, island height, clearances around an island, space between work areas, walking aisles.  
• Different organization logics: zone-based (prep, cook, clean, store), triangle-based, and linear workflows.  
• Placement of everyday items vs occasional items for maximum practicality.  
• Safety and comfort: distances from cooktop to sink, oven placement, corners, and pathways.

Present this as a clean, labeled diagram or infographic, with arrows, zones, and measurements, showing a realistic open kitchen attached to a living/dining space. Prioritize clarity, practicality, and real-world usability over aesthetics.
