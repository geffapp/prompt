You are an expert kitchen planner and architectural illustrator. Create a clear, didactic image that explains the logic of a highly functional, comfortable open kitchen, not the interior design style.

Focus on:
• Showing the “work triangle” (fridge–sink–cooktop) and efficient circulation paths, based on proven principles from designers like Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, Johnny Grey, and contemporary kitchen ergonomics.  
• Indicating ideal height ranges for countertop, wall cabinets, tall units, and appliances, with simple labels (e.g., eye level, comfortable reach, below counter).  
• Demonstrating zones: preparation, cooking, cleaning, storage (dry, cold, cookware), and serving, with clear boundaries and examples of what goes where.  
• Showing how the kitchen opens to the living/dining area while keeping noisy/messy zones slightly set back.  
• Emphasizing ergonomics: minimal bending and stretching, logical sequences (take food → wash → prep → cook → serve), and safe distances between appliances and circulation paths.

Style: clean, schematic, and easy to understand, like an instructional diagram or architect’s concept sketch, with labels and arrows, minimal decoration, and a neutral, timeless look.
