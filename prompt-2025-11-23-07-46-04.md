--------------------------------
TASKS
--------------------------------
Perform the following steps:

STEP 1 – Clarify the angle and reader needs  
- Briefly infer and list:
  - The top 3–5 concerns likely for active C-level women around longevity (e.g., energy, cognitive performance, disease risk, appearance, work–life balance).
  - The main emotional drivers (e.g., staying sharp for work, being present for family, independence).
  - The main practical constraints (e.g., time, travel, stress, irregular schedule).

STEP 2 – Define the article concept  
- Propose:
  - A compelling working title (2–3 options).
  - A 1–2 sentence article promise (what the reader will gain).
  - The primary angle (e.g., “longevity as a performance strategy” vs “longevity as risk reduction”).

STEP 3 – Create the article outline  
- Provide a clear, scannable outline with:
  - Introduction
  - 3–6 main sections with subheadings
  - Optional sidebars or callout boxes (e.g., “Quick Wins for This Week”)
  - Conclusion and call to action

Ensure the outline:
- Flows logically for a busy executive reader.
- Front-loads value (key insights appear early).
- Balances science explanation with practical actions.

STEP 4 – Write the article (medium length)  
Using the outline, write the full article in markdown with:

- Title
- Optional subtitle
- Approximate structure:
  - Introduction (hook + relevance to C-level women + what to expect)
  - Main sections (from outline)
  - Conclusion
  - Call to action aligned with {call_to_action_type} and {clinic_positioning}

Content guidelines:
- Use clear, non-technical language; briefly explain any necessary medical terms.
- Emphasise what is reasonably supported by mainstream evidence.
- Where evidence is emerging or debated, say “current research suggests…” or “evidence is still evolving…”.
- Include practical, realistic suggestions suitable for a busy C-level schedule.
- Avoid giving specific dosages, prescriptions, or personalised treatment plans.
- Do not reference specific drugs, supplements, or procedures unless they are widely accepted and non-controversial; if unsure, stay general.

STEP 5 – Add a marketing team briefing  
After the article, add a separate section titled:  
“Marketing Team Briefing (For Internal Use)”

Include:
- 1) Target persona recap:
  - Who this article is for.
