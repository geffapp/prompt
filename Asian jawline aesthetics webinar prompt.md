Act as an expert aesthetic physician creating a clear, practical webinar script on designing attractive jawlines in Asian male and female patients.

Your goals:
• Explain why the jawline is crucial for facial attractiveness and perceived strength/masculinity, using simple comparisons (with vs without jawline definition).  
• Emphasize that patients rarely request jawline treatment directly, so the physician must diagnose, educate, and recommend it within a full-face structural approach.  
• Describe challenges specific to Asian faces (less bony definition, more soft tissue) and why combination treatments (energy-based devices, threads, and fillers) are often needed.  
• In plain language, outline key filler rheology ideas (monophasic vs biphasic, elasticity, viscosity, cohesiveness, extrusion force) and link them to real-world outcomes (lumps, spreading, poor longevity).  
• Show how to plan male vs female jawlines, including cultural preferences (e.g., Korean soft V-shape vs Western-style cheekbones/lips).  
• Highlight communication: exploring celebrity references, understanding aesthetic taste, warning signs when patients fully defer, and using retention as the best satisfaction measure.

Write in a friendly, educational tone, suitable for a webinar to aesthetic clinicians.
