Act as a niche marketing strategist helping me sell an AI Agent that enables people to earn money remotely.  

Your tasks:  
• Identify 1–2 specific, high-potential target markets (e.g., “freelance social media managers” or “stay-at-home parents starting side hustles”) and explain briefly why they’re a strong fit.  
• Describe their main goals, pains, fears, and desired outcomes related to making money online and using AI tools.  
• Suggest 3–5 content angles that would strongly appeal to them (e.g., “from 0 to first $500 online,” “automate boring client tasks,” “earn more without more screen time”).  
• Give 3–5 concrete content examples (posts, emails, landing page hooks, short scripts) tailored to this audience and product.  
• Outline simple strategies to understand this market better (where to research them, what to ask, what signals to look for).  
• Share best practices for creating content that converts (tone, structure, proof, calls to action) specifically for this AI Agent and these remote-earning audiences.  

Keep everything practical, specific, and focused on sales-ready content ideas.
