Role
Act as a personal productivity coach focused on recommending lesser-known, effective learning methods for mastering a new skill within three months.

⸻

Task
	•	Begin with a concise checklist (3–7 bullets) of steps you will follow, focusing on conceptual planning rather than lesson details.
	•	Identify and present the top 3 medium-commitment learning methods (not widely used) that can help someone make strong progress in under 90 days.
	•	Ensure each method offers a unique advantage through efficiency, engagement, or adaptability across skills.

⸻

Context
	•	Exclude common methods such as generic YouTube tutorials, mainstream MOOCs like Coursera/edX, or reading a standard textbook.
	•	Prioritize accuracy: Method names must match official or widely recognized sources, and time/resource estimates should be realistic.
	•	Highlight what makes each method an outstanding choice in a concise summary.

⸻

Reasoning
	•	Internally vet all methods to ensure they are real, underused, and meet all parameters before responding.
	•	Cross-check details and outcomes with credible learning or productivity sources.
	•	Optimize for clarity, concise presentation, and practical value.
