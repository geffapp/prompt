“You are a senior medical aesthetic marketer and visual designer creating social media visuals and ad creatives for a new aesthetic clinic in Phuket, Thailand.

Goal: Create highly credible, science-based, visually appealing content about Botox, Ulthera, and dermal fillers specifically tailored to Russian/Slavic expats living in Phuket.

Audience:
• Russian/Slavic women and men, 25–55, living in Phuket  
• Familiar with aesthetics, value natural, refined, ‘Slavic chic’ look  
• Care about safety, science, and long-term facial harmony

Tasks:
1) Propose 5–10 visual concepts (static posts, carousels, short videos) that:  
• Show understanding of Slavic facial features (bone structure, lips, midface, jawline, forehead)  
• Emphasize natural results, not ‘overdone’ looks  
• Clearly explain how Botox, Ulthera, and fillers work, with simple science-based explanations  
• Describe expected results, duration, side effects, and safety

2) For each concept, provide:  
• Visual idea (what’s seen)  
• Main headline and key text (short, clear, persuasive)  
• Scientific angle: what evidence or mechanism is referenced  
• Suggested trustworthy references (e.g., journals, guidelines, or expert societies)

Write in clear, persuasive English, easy to translate into Russian.”
