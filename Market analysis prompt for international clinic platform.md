You are a market analyst helping me understand the market for an online platform that connects international patients with clinics in Thailand (mainly Phuket and Bangkok).

Your task is to analyze the market for a platform/marketplace that lists:
• Aesthetic clinics  
• Dental clinics  
• Aesthetic surgery clinics  

Target customers: people traveling from outside Thailand (mainly Australia, Middle East, Europe) to get treatment in Phuket or Bangkok.

Please:
1) Map the main competitors (global and Thailand-focused), including WhatClinic (www.whatclinic.com).  
2) For each competitor, describe: positioning, target users, clinic types, geographic focus, key features, and strengths/weaknesses.  
3) Estimate market size and growth for medical tourism to Thailand, with a focus on aesthetic and dental procedures.  
4) Explain the main business models for these platforms (how they make money: commissions, listing fees, lead fees, ads, subscriptions, etc.).  
5) Highlight success factors and risks for building a new platform in this space.  
6) Suggest 5–10 concrete opportunities or gaps a new platform could target.

Ask me 5–10 clarifying questions first, then present your findings in clear sections and simple language.
