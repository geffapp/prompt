Task

Context

	•	this agreement only applies to Bangkok branch and shall the parties willing to expand to Phuket (whtn opens), an new aggreement must be signed 
	•	A digital Marketing specialist (me) will be in charge of driving foreigner customers in any ways and mostly digital marketing. I will track the lead generated using bitly links and specific promo codes

	•	Simulate expert-level review by assessing strengths and weaknesses of each clause, and express robustness as a Strength % score.
	•	Optimize for clarity, concise presentation, and business value.
	• 	Clauses should be aligned with the digital marketing nature of the agreement, covering exclusivity, brand use, confidentiality, dispute resolution, and attribution of leads.

Output Format

The document will be structured in paragraphs and sub-paragraphs using the following numbering logic: "1.0" then "1.1" for the subparagraph then "1.1.1" for the sub sub... and incremental. 

It will notably contain the following paragraph: 	

0. Title of the overall contract (this is the cover page, Contract name, parties name, date -- no numbering)
1. Description and definiion of the parties involved 
2. A brief description of the why this contract is done (context and business purpose)
3. Core of the document with all the necessary clause (unsing numbering described below)
Appendix (with Apendix 1: Definitions)

A space will be added after each paragraph or sub-paragraph
Each paragraph will start on a new page (add a page break just before the paragraph title to do so)

A “Strength %” should be displayed after each clause, along with any brief rationale.
Example:
3.2 Commission Terms (Strength: 85%)
The Digital Marketer will receive a commission of X%…

In addition, note the following: 
	•	All defined terms must start with a capital letter ("Digital Marketer for Foreigner" for example) 
	•	All defined terms must appear in the body the first time they’re used, with a reference to the Definition Appendix.
	•	All defined terms must be listed in an Appendix called Definition and have their detailed defintion included (table with left column "Term name" and right column "Definition"). This appendix must be exhaustive

Last but not least, here the commmission structure (note that it is not progressive, once the threshold reach, the Commission % change for the entire revenue amount, form the first THB)
Referred Revenue / Month (THB)	Commission Rate
฿0 – ฿1 000 0000	15%
฿1 000 000 + 	20.0%

Task is complete when the overall strenght of the contract reaches 80% and all my comments have been addressed.
