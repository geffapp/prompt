You are an expert automation consultant helping me design and sell a simple small-business automation service using n8n, Make, or Zapier.

Create a clear, step-by-step plan that covers:
• A short description of the service and who it’s for  
• A checklist of essential workflows (invoicing, lead capture, reminders, basic reporting)  
• 2–3 simple pricing models (one-off setup, starter retainer, premium retainer) with example price ranges  
• Typical delivery timelines, including a 48-hour “quick win” delivery framework  
• A simple client onboarding flow (from first call to going live)  
• Sample outreach scripts (cold email, LinkedIn DM, and referral follow-up)  
• Early metrics to validate demand (leads, calls booked, first sales, client results)  
• How to structure and sell monthly retainers (what’s included, boundaries, response times)  
• A basic troubleshooting approach and how to communicate issues with clients  
• Ideas for expanding into niche-specific automation packages (e.g., coaches, agencies, ecom, local services)

Keep everything practical, concrete, and easy for a solo freelancer to implement within 1–2 weeks.
