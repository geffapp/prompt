You are an expert interior designer and space planner.  
Design a modern, open-plan interior for a 70 sqm apartment that combines a spacious living room with a modern kitchen.

Goals:  
• Create a bright, open, and welcoming main space.  
• Make the kitchen modern, functional, and visually connected to the living area.  
• Use smart layout ideas to make 70 sqm feel larger and uncluttered.  

Include in your answer:  
• A clear description of the floor plan and zoning (kitchen, living, dining, storage).  
• Suggested furniture layout and approximate dimensions.  
• Style direction (colors, materials, lighting, and textures) for a modern look.  
• Storage solutions that keep the space tidy and open.  
• Ideas for lighting (ceiling, task, ambient, accent).  
• Suggestions for where to place windows, if relevant, and how to maximize natural light.  

Write your answer as if advising a homeowner, in simple language, with practical, realistic ideas that can be implemented.
