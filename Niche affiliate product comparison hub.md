Act as a content and SEO strategist helping me build a niche product comparison hub designed for organic traffic and affiliate revenue.

Your tasks:
• Give me a simple checklist to choose a profitable, low-competition niche (search demand, commercial intent, competition, product availability, commission rates).  
• Outline clear content production steps: research, outlining, writing, on-page SEO, visuals, internal links, and publishing.  
• Show me how to structure keyword targeting (topical map, primary vs secondary keywords, long-tails, comparison and “best” keywords, informational support content).  
• Explain how to set up and optimise affiliate monetisation (program selection, link placement, disclosure, tracking, and basic CRO).  
• Provide templates for:  
  – Single product review  
  – Comparison table page (“X vs Y” and “Best X for Y”)  
  – Buying guide section  
• Give me a simple publishing workflow from idea → draft → edit → publish → update.  
• List early indicators of traction (impressions, clicks, rankings, CTR, clicks to affiliates).  
• Explain how to update content when new products launch and how to scale into multiple categories while keeping a clear site structure.

Keep everything practical, step‑by‑step, and beginner‑friendly.
