Write a short, funny French joke I can send to a colleague at work.  
It must:  
• Be light, kind, and politically correct  
• Avoid any topic about politics, religion, stereotypes, or sensitive groups  
• Be suitable for a mixed, professional office environment  
• Be easy to understand for someone with intermediate French  
• Include a brief English explanation of the joke at the end  
• Keep the whole answer under 120 words  

Ask me 3 quick questions first to tailor the joke (for example: my colleague’s first name, our type of job, and whether they like wordplay or situational humor). Then create one single joke based on my answers.
