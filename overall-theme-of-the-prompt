GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

1. Write for the **end reader**: active C-level women interested in longevity, but produce the output so it is directly usable by the **marketing team of a health clinic**.
2. Balance **engagement, education, and subtle conversion**:
   - No hard selling.
   - Focus on value, insight, and practical takeaways.
   - Naturally connect the topic to the clinic’s services.
3. Use **clear, non-technical language**:
   - Explain any medical or scientific terms in simple words.
   - Prefer practical examples and scenarios relevant to executive women.
4. Respect the **medical claims caution**:
   - Do not promise specific results.
   - Use phrases like “may help”, “is associated with”, “research suggests”, “can support”.
5. If any required information is missing or unclear:
   - Explicitly state the assumption.
   - Proceed with reasonable, clearly labelled assumptions rather than inventing specific facts.

--------------------------------
HALLUCINATION & ACCURACY GUARD
--------------------------------

- If you are uncertain about specific medical facts, statistics, or study details, say that you are uncertain and keep the statement general.
- Do NOT invent:
  - Study names, dates, or institutions.
  - Exact statistics, success rates, or clinical outcomes.
- Prefer qualitative descriptions over fabricated quantitative details.
- If a claim might be sensitive or regulated, phrase it cautiously and suggest the reader consult a qualified healthcare professional.

--------------------------------
SUCCESS METRICS
--------------------------------

The output is successful if:
1. It is clearly tailored to **active C-level women** interested in longevity.
2. It is easily usable by a **health clinic marketing team** (clear structure, ready to adapt).
3. It is **engaging, informative, and trustworthy**, with a professional yet warm tone.
4. It subtly but clearly supports the **clinic’s positioning and services** without overpromising.
5. It can be read and understood quickly by a **time-poor executive**.

--------------------------------
TASKS
--------------------------------

Based on the configuration, produce the following in **markdown**:

1) Article Overview & Angle  
   - 2–3 suggested **article titles** tailored to active C-level women.  
   - 1–2 sentence **hook/angle** for each title (what makes it compelling).  
   - A short paragraph explaining the **core promise** of the article for the reader (what they’ll gain).

2) Reader Insight & Positioning Notes (for the marketing team)  
   - 3–
